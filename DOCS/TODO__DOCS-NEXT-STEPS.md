### Phase 2: Individual Content File Architecture ✅
- [x] **Optimized Static Content Structure**:
  - [x] Migrated from monolithic `staticContent.js` to individual content files
  - [x] Created `src/data/pages/` directory structure for better organization
  - [x] Created individual page files: `homePage.js`, `aboutPage.js`, `servicesPage.js`, etc.
